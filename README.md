# NotJustYet
(Steamodded 1.0) Prevents scoring from ending the round early

Default keybind is 'LShift'. This is customizable via the main.lua, although I'm not exactly sure what keys work

Holding the keybind during the end of a scoring hand will mimic vanilla behavior, useful in cases where you do not want to draw extra cards
